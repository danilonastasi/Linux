# Update and Upgrade the Ubuntu 22.04
# To update and upgrade packages on Ubuntu 22.04, firstly, open up the terminal 
# by pressing “CTRL+ALT+T” and execute the following command:
sudo apt update

# Now, upgrade the system packages with the help of the following command:
sudo apt upgrade

# Now, on your Ubuntu 22.04 system, download and install required dependencies. 
# These dependencies are used to execute the R on Ubuntu 22.04. Run the following 
# command for the specified purpose:
sudo apt install dirmngr gnupg apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common

# Authenticate the installed packages by writing out the following command:
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9

# Next, import the GPG key in your system through below command:
wget -O- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/cran.gpg

# After importing the GPG key, you need to add the CRAN repository that is highly recommended for R installation:
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cran.gpg] https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)-cran40/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cran.list

# Once the repository is imported, refresh the APT repository list by using the update command:
sudo apt update

# Now, your Ubuntu 22.04 system is ready to install the R language from the CRAN repository. 
To do so, type the following command:
sudo apt install r-base

# After installing the R language on Ubuntu 22.04, verify its existence by checking the build version:
R --version

# Next, run the R environment first by using “R” command in the terminal:
sudo R

# to install packages like 'raster' do first:
sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev  # to install library GDAL

# from R terminal:
install.packages("raster")

wget -qO- https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/marutter_pubkey.asc | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/cran_ubuntu_key.asc
