# How to install MySQL server on Ubuntu 22.04
# from the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmdrb420NNw:
# from the ubuntu terminal:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
# to login in sql:
sudo mysql
# now the terminal is under MySQL:
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'yourpassword';
exit # to back to ubuntu terminal
# type:
sudo mysql_secure_installation
# enter the password you decided
# - click yes
# - click a number between 0 and 2
# - click no
# - click yes
# - click yes
# - click yes
# - click yes

# to login now in your MySQL you need to enter user and password so:
sudo mysql -u root -p 
# enter password sql
# now you anre in MySQL terminal
# let's create a database:

CREATE DATABASE exampleDB;
show schemas;
# you get result

# it is better to create a new user, user root is not the best option:
CREATE USER 'abstract-programemr'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'yournewpassword'; 
# it is better do not use the same password used for other users or root

use mysql;
select user from user;
grant all on exxampleDB.* to 'abstract-programmer'@'localhost';
exit

# that's done! You are using the MySQL 'abstract-programmer'. Remember that when you configure the MySQL workbench.
